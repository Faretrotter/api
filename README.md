# Faretrotter API v2.0

Faretrotter API supports routes and places search for travel.  Account access and documentation is managed over [here](http://www.faretrotter.com/api/).

## Getting started

To get started, you'll first need to [create an account](https://www.faretrotter.com/api/register).  Second, you will need to generate a set of keys for whichever environment you'll be hitting.

## Bugs, enhancements, etc.

Please use GitHub to make enhancement requests and report bugs.  In general, please follow these rules:

### State the problem
The ideal request describes issue at hand and secondly, the context in which the feature will be used. It can be hard to write about context because you already know it so well that it might seem obvious! The best improvements are made with a solid understanding of how it's used.

### Propose a solution
In describing a potential, address how it might remedy the problem at large.  What might be one solution?  Are there others?
